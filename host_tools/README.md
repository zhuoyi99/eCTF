# Host Tools

This folder holds all of the host tools. We have included an example secret
generation script (it's not very secret though, is it?) to show how commands can
be called during the system build (`1_build_saffire.Dockerfile`) process.
You are not required to have a `secret_generator`, and any files saved in this
folder will be available during the system build process.
