# Authentication
Authentication is done via the CHAP protocol. The bootloader and host tools share a key generated from /dev/urandom.

The host tools authenticates to the bootloader by computing SHA256(CHALLENGE || SECRET), with CHALLENGE given by the bootloader. If the bootloader computes an identical hash, it has authenticated the host.

The protocol requires random challenges, which are generated by SHA256(COUNTER || SEED), with COUNTER being a monotonically increasing counter and SEED being a random seed value both stored in EEPROM.
